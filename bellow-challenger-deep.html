            </header>

            <p class="project-text">
                <em>Bellow Challenger Deep</em> is a genre short film that combines 
                deep-sea exploration, industrial exploitation and cosmic horror.
                The story takes place almost entirely inside a single environment: 
                an exploration submarine dropped to the very bottom of the Pacific Ocean,
                into the Challenger Deep.
            </p>

            <p class="project-text">
                Only two characters are involved:
                <strong>Ekko</strong>, the pilot and sole human on board; and 
                <strong>Martha</strong>, her operator and only contact with the surface, 
                seen exclusively through screens and video feeds.
            </p>

            <p class="project-text">
                Hired by a deep-sea mining company, they are sent to investigate the sudden silence 
                of an abyssal drilling base and the failure of several unmanned probes. 
                What begins as a technical mission quickly turns into a descent towards something 
                far older, larger, and more incomprehensible than any human structure.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- STORY & ATMOSPHERE -->
        <section class="section" id="story">
            <header class="section-header">
                <h2>Story &amp; Atmosphere</h2>
            </header>

            <p class="project-text">
                The film is built as a <strong>pressure-driven chamber piece</strong>:
                one real set – the interior of the submarine – and an outside world that is 
                entirely created in 3D: the ocean floor, the wrecked drilling base, the abyss,
                and the creature itself.
            </p>

            <p class="project-text">
                Ekko's mission seems straightforward:
            </p>

            <ul class="project-list">
                <li>Locate the missing probes sent by the company.</li>
                <li>Reach the deep-sea base <strong>Beyond Five</strong>, installed near the Challenger Deep.</li>
                <li>Recover the data and understand why the station went dark.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="project-text">
                As she descends, light disappears, pressure rises, and the signals become increasingly erratic.
                The drones are found crushed, mangled by forces that do not match standard mechanical failure.
                Beyond Five lies torn open at the edge of a <strong>newly-formed fracture</strong> in the seabed
                – a crevasse that does not appear on any map, as if the geology itself has shifted around something.
            </p>

            <p class="project-text">
                Ekko gradually understands that the catastrophe is not only industrial or seismic.
                Beneath the station, below the trench, something is vast enough to deform the ocean floor –
                and to start bending Ekko's perception of reality.

                <p>
                    The central entity of <strong>Bellow Challenger Deep</strong> is a personal reinterpretation of Cthulhu, designed to feel:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Colossal</strong> – on the scale of a drowned city.</li>
                    <li><strong>Both human-like and monstrous</strong>, capable of echoing familiar forms to influence Ekko.</li>
                    <li>
                        Mostly seen in <strong>fragments</strong> – silhouettes, masses in the darkness, glimpses of skin, 
                        tentacles and impossible proportions, long before any full reveal.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The goal is not to show everything in a single clean shot, but to let the viewer’s imagination work from a few 
                        strong, unsettling images: organic textures, almost mineral, metallic reflections under the water, and a sense 
                        of a living mass surrounding the creature rather than a simple outline.

                Ekko's submarine is treated almost as a character of its own:

                <li>A fully enclosed cockpit, no glass dome, no external view without cameras.</li>

                It is designed to feel realistic for a contemporary deep-sea industrial mission,

                including pressure spikes and direct contact with the creature.

                The drilling base <strong>Beyond Five</strong> and the corporate universe of the client
